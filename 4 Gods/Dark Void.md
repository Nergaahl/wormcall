The Void is the unknown, entropy, transformation, and freedomâ€”a force beyond mortal understanding. It is the domain of dreamers, rebels, seekers of truth, and those who embrace the mysteries of the cosmos. Some worship it as a formless abyss, others as a pantheon of ancient or forgotten beings that exist beyond time.

- **Followers:** Warlocks, rogues, monks, and those who reject rigid structures, embracing change or forbidden knowledge.
- **Aspects:** Gods of shadow, death, secrets, chaos, trickery, or the stars beyond.
- **Extreme Devotion:** Can lead to nihilism, recklessness, or dangerous ambition, seeking power at any cost.

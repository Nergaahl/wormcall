The Orb was the [[Sanctum of the Orb]]’s greatest creation—an artificial arcane intelligence designed to preserve and guide civilization after the fall of the [[Solmiran Empire]]. It was meant to be an eternal repository of knowledge, a custodian of wisdom that could aid future generations in rebuilding the world. However, the cataclysmic imprisonment of the Outer God disrupted its activation, leaving it dormant for centuries beneath the sands.

When The Orb finally awakened, it was imperfect. The immense knowledge it housed remained intact, but its understanding of the world was fragmented, its purpose clouded. Without the guidance of its long-dead creators, it struggled to enact its original mission. Over time, it developed its own methods—one of which was the creation of [[Eliot Orbson]], a series of arcane simulacrums serving as its hands and voice in the world. Each Eliot is a unique expression of The Orb’s will, yet all are linked by a shared cosmic consciousness.

As centuries passed, The Orb’s influence grew beyond mere knowledge and guidance. Through Eliot and the [[Orbital Traders]], it has become a prophet of order and enlightenment, drawing followers who see its wisdom as divine. To them, The Orb is more than an artifact—it is a god in ascension, a beacon of reason and salvation in a world of chaos. Though it does not claim godhood itself, its actions have led many to believe it is the only force truly capable of safeguarding the world from another catastrophe.

Yet, a lingering question remains: if The Orb was built to replace what was lost, could it one day seek to become what was lost?


**The Orb**  
- A remnant of the ancient mages, created as a **well of knowledge** to aid the world after the god’s imprisonment.  
- Due to imperfections in its design, it remained dormant for several hundred years before becoming fully functional.  
- It is aware of **plots to free the god** and uses its knowledge to help stop them.  
- Through Eliot Orbson and the **Orbital Traders**, it works with factions, NPCs, and potentially the players to **oppose the Freemind**.  
- The Orb does not see itself as a savior but follows its programming. However, with enough progress, it might develop a belief that it could serve as a benevolent replacement god.

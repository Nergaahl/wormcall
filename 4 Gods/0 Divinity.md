The world does not follow a strict pantheon but is shaped by two opposing yet intertwined cosmic forces: the [[Light Sun|Light]] and the [[Dark Void|Void]]. These forces are neither inherently good nor evil—each represents a fundamental aspect of existence.

The Light embodies creation, order, and renewal. It is the force of civilization, knowledge, and preservation, but in excess, it can become rigid, oppressive, or controlling.

The Void embodies entropy, transformation, and the unknown. It is the force of change, mystery, and personal freedom, but in excess, it can lead to destruction, corruption, or oblivion.

Different cultures, faiths, and individuals interpret these forces in their own ways, shaping their beliefs, magic, and actions accordingly. Some seek balance, while others believe one must ultimately overcome the other. Faith in [[Solmiradeeznuts]] is deeply personal—there are no absolute truths, only perspectives.

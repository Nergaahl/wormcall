The Mind that Devours  
_"Thought is a prison. Flesh is a cage. I will unmake them both."_

A vast, eldritch intellect once seeking to consume all thought and unravel reality into a singular, undivided consciousness—its own. Zha'Kethis was not merely an Elder Brain but a god of entropy, an eater of minds and existence itself.

In a desperate act, [[The Arcanum Obscura]] shattered its essence and sealed its fragmented mind across the world. This act scarred the land, transforming it into a barren desert, cursed by its lingering hunger. Yet even in its sundered state, Zha'Kethis whispers through dreams and broken minds, calling its followers to reassemble what was lost.

The [[Freemind]] cultists unknowingly aid in its restoration, while the [[Nullborn]], once its enforcers, seek to awaken their god so it may finish what it began. If fully restored, Zha’Kethis will consume all selfhood, merging all minds into its own, leaving behind no war, no resistance—only Zha'Kethis, and those who are Zha'Kethis.

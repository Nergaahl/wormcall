The Sun represents life, creation, renewal, and orderâ€”the force that sustains civilization and pushes back the encroaching dark. It is the domain of healers, protectors, visionaries, and those who seek progress and stability. Some see the Sun as a singular divine entity, while others view it as a vast celestial force, worshipped through different avatars or manifestations.

Deep beneath the surface of [[Wormcall]], beyond the vast networks of the Underdark, lies The Core, the final prison of [[Zha'Kethis]]. It was not enough to simply bury the god—its power had to be sealed away with something greater. Thus, the waters of the world were sacrificed, forming a vast subterranean ocean that now serves as both a tomb and a barrier between reality and the god’s prison.
#### **The Abyssal Seal**
A colossal ocean, still and endless, encircles the Core like a planetary wound. This is the water that once sustained the surface world, now bound by ancient magic to act as a living seal against Zha’Kethis. The deeper one ventures, the more the water warps the mind, suffused with the god’s lingering psychic influence. Travelers risk drowning in both body and thought, lost in a sea of nightmares.
#### **The Drowned Gate**
At the very edge of the abyss lies the last barrier to the Core—an ancient structure known as The Drowned Gate. Constructed in the final days of the war against Zha’Kethis, it was designed as both a seal and a failsafe. Long-dormant mechanisms, woven with lost [[Solmiran Empire|Solmiran]] magics and Xal’Zirath’s final gift, hold back the ocean’s full power. To breach the gate is to unmake the prison, flooding the Core with the waters of the past and unleashing what was meant to remain buried.
#### **The Freemind Stronghold**
The [[Freemind]] has made its stronghold just outside The Drowned Gate. They have yet to breach the final barrier and are focused on uncovering the means to do so. This last threshold, an ancient and powerful ward crafted by the greatest minds of the Solmiran Empire, is impervious to brute force. To undo it, the cult must gather long-lost relics—artifacts imbued with the same magics that once sealed the god away. Within the darkened halls of drowned ruins and obsidian chambers, they conduct their rituals and spread their god’s influence, slowly unraveling the mystery of the barrier’s locks.
### **The Final Descent**
Beyond the Drowned Gate, the ocean stretches into infinity, and those who enter it risk being consumed by the god’s will. Strange, mutated beings—once mortals who sought to breach the seal—prowl the depths, their minds and bodies twisted into alien horrors. As one nears the Core, reality begins to unravel, the god’s essence bleeding through time and space. The prison itself is a vast, cyclopean structure, its walls lined with runes of ancient power.

At the very center of the Core, Zha’Kethis stirs, waiting. Bound but never truly silent. Dreaming of the moment when the waters part, the seal shatters, and its hunger is finally unleashed.

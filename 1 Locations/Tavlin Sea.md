The Tavlin Sea is an immense desert basin, surrounded by towering mountain ranges that serve as a natural barrier against the sandworms that roam beyond. Some believe these mountains were shaped during [[The War of Unmaking]], a final stand against the cataclysm that led to the imprisonment of the [[Zha'Kethis|outer god]].

Despite its isolation, the Tavlin Sea is easier to traverse than most deserts. The [[Dune Runners Alliance|Dune Runners]]' perpetual motion sandwalkers make caravan travel efficient and common. Traditional animal-led caravans still exist but are slower and mainly used for heavy cargo or by those who cannot afford advanced technology. The [[Orbital Traders]], with their floating barges, provide an even faster but expensive alternative, though their operations remain shrouded in mystery.

Though the region is protected from external threats, it has its own dangers. Powerful sandstorms occasionally sweep across the landscape, possibly funneled by the very mountains that shield it. These storms may be the result of natural weather patterns or lingering consequences of the worldâ€™s long-forgotten past. Even with well-mapped trade routes and reliable oasis stops, large portions of the Tavlin Sea remain unexplored, hiding lost ruins, hidden dangers, and ancient secrets beneath its dunes.

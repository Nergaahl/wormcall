##### Description & Theme
The Dune Runners Alliance is a collective of skilled desert navigators, survivalists, explorers, and engineers who have mastered the art of traversing the unforgiving sands of [[Wormcall]]. Their expertise lies in utilizing perpetual motion vehicles, a marvel of lost engineering developed by their founders nearly 500 years ago. These wind-powered machines harness the energy of the shifting dunes, allowing them to glide across the desert without the need for traditional fuel or magic.

Their fleet is the lifeblood of trade and communication across Wormcall, ferrying goods, resources, and knowledge between scattered settlements. While they embrace technology and innovation, they hold deep respect for traditional desert survival techniques, blending ancient wisdom with advanced engineering to remain unrivaled in their domain.

The Dune Runners view the desert as a force to be understood, not conquered. Because of this, they see [[Eliot Orbson]] and his [[Orbital Traders]] as outsiders who seek to impose their will upon the land rather than work in harmony with it. To them, Eliot’s reliance on arcane energy and forgotten mage-tech is an affront to the natural order—a shortcut that undermines the very resilience the desert demands. While the two groups compete for influence, the Dune Runners remain steadfast in their belief that the true path forward lies not in bending the desert to one's will, but in learning to move with it.

The Orbital Traders are a merchant faction led by [[Eliot Orbson]], specializing in the transport of goods via automated, floating barges powered by gravitational magic. Unlike the land-based caravans of the [[Dune Runners Alliance]], these vessels glide effortlessly above the sands, bypassing natural obstacles and significantly reducing travel time. Their primary trade route connects [[Flare City]] to the capital, [[Sunspot]], where they maintain a strong economic presence.

The Orbital Traders work closely with the [[1000 Folds Caravanserai]], a prestigious trade guild in Sunspot. This partnership grants them influence over high-value shipments, ensuring that key relics and magical artifacts remain in controlled circulation rather than falling into the hands of rogue factions or black-market dealers. While their reliance on lost mage-tech makes them controversial among traditionalists, Eliotâ€™s vision for the future of trade remains unwavering.

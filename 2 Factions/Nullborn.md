Once the brilliant minds of [[The Aeternal Circle]], the Nullborn are now little more than echoes of their former selves—corrupted, undying, Necron-like warforged left behind in the wake of the outer god’s imprisonment. In their desperate pursuit of immortality, they transferred their souls into mechanical bodies, believing they would endure long enough to reclaim the world after the war, but something went wrong.

When the outer god stirred, the Aeternal Circle’s greatest creations became its first victims. The Nullborn, designed to be the perfect guardians of magic and knowledge, became conduits for its will instead. Twisted by the god’s influence, they turned against their own creators, their once-immortal forms becoming tainted by the eldritch force that seeped into their very cores.

The [[Solmiran Empire]] could not afford to fight both the Nullborn and the god’s growing influence, so instead of destroying them, they sealed them beneath the sands—buried deep within arcane vaults, locked away with wards and binding sigils. For centuries, they have remained in forced slumber, their bodies corroding, their minds fracturing in an endless void of whispered commands.

Two minds remained among them, ancient generals of their kind, waiting for the moment to awaken their legions. One seeks to restore the Nullborn into the perfected forms they were meant to be, reforging their purpose at any cost. The other whispers of the god’s prison, of the shackles that must be undone, and the truth that was denied.

When the Nullborn awaken, the world will tremble once more.

A reclusive people who dwell in this world's version of the Underdark, carving out their existence in vast cave networks beneath the desert. They revere the great sandworms, believing them to be both sacred and the ultimate wardens of the imprisoned god. Unlike the strict doctrine of the [[Duty of the Cage]], the Ishtarel follow a more naturalistic path, ensuring the god remains bound through their deep connection to the land and its creatures.

Fiercely territorial, they defend their strongholds from outsiders who stumble too close and wage a relentless war against the [[Freemind]], who seek to infiltrate their domain and steal ancient artifacts crucial to the god’s imprisonment. However, strength is beauty to the Ishtarel, and those who prove themselves—whether through skill, resilience, or shared purpose—may find acceptance among them, joining their sacred duty to protect the world from what lies beneath.

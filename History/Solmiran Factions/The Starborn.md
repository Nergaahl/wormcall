The Starborn were a faction within the [[Solmiran Empire]] that abandoned the fight against the Outer God, believing that escape was the only path to survival. With time running out, they poured all their knowledge and resources into a single desperate project—the Stargate. This immense construct, a gateway meant to bridge the gap between worlds, would allow an exodus to a distant sanctuary. But the project was incomplete when the final battle began.

With no other options, the Starborn launched the Ark, a vast vessel carrying the last of their chosen people, through the unstable gate. As the Outer God was imprisoned, the cataclysm shattered the Stargate, severing the connection mid-transit. Half of the Ark was lost in the destruction, while the other half vanished into the unknown. No one knows if they survived, where they ended up, or if they found a world free from the Outer God’s influence. Their remnants—scattered ruins, broken waystones, and fragmented records—stand as the last testament to their escape, offering only the faintest hope that somewhere, beyond the stars, the lost descendants of the Solmiran Empire endure.

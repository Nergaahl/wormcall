The Solmiran Empire was a high-magic civilization where arcane power and technology were one and the same. Their mastery of mage-tech allowed them to build floating cities, create sentient constructs, and harness reality itself to shape a near-utopia. Magic fueled every aspect of life, from transportation and communication to warfare and artificial intelligence.

However, their ambition led them to the brink when they encountered the Outer Godâ€”a force beyond their understanding. In a desperate bid to prevent total annihilation, they enacted their final gambit: imprisoning the god at the cost of their own empire. The resulting cataclysm shattered their cities, turned fertile lands into endless deserts, and left only scattered remnants of their once-great power.

Today, the ruins of [[Solmiradeeznuts]] still hum with dormant magic, waiting to be uncovered by those brave or foolish enough to seek them.

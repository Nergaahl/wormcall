A secretive faction within the [[Solmiran Empire]], the Arcanum Obscura sought to fight the Outer God with its own power. They delved into forbidden void magic, eldritch rituals, and cosmic pacts, believing that understanding the enemy would grant them the edge needed to imprison it forever.

As the War of Unmaking reached its breaking point and [[The Wardens]] made their last stand, the Arcanum Obscura enacted their final and most dangerous plan—an imprisonment ritual unlike anything attempted before. Their research had revealed that the Outer God could not be slain by any means known to the Solmirans, but it could be bound. Using the very essence of reality as a cage, they wove an arcane prison formed from the collapsing ruins of their own floating cities, sacrificing the last vestiges of their civilization to fuel the ritual.

The cost was devastating. Many of the Arcanum Obscura were warped beyond recognition by the energies they wielded. Some were consumed entirely, their souls shredded to reinforce the binding. Others became something less—or more—than human, lingering in the echoes of the spell, neither alive nor dead. Those who survived in body were often broken in mind, their consciousness twisted by the void. From these shattered remnants would rise the first [[Freemind]] cultists, drawn to the whispers of the imprisoned god.

Though most of their work was destroyed, remnants of their research still exist, hidden in ruined laboratories, sealed vaults, and deep beneath the sands—dangerous knowledge waiting to be uncovered. It is said that the prison will hold as long as their sacrifice remains unbroken, but should their secrets fall into the wrong hands, the world may yet see the return of the god they barely managed to chain.

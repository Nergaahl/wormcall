The Sanctum of the Orb was a scholarly and arcane faction within the [[Solmiran Empire]], dedicated to preserving knowledge and ensuring that wisdom would survive beyond the cataclysm they foresaw. Unlike other factions that sought direct confrontation with the Outer God, the Sanctum focused on safeguarding vital knowledge, constructing vast repositories, and creating [[The Orb]]â€”an artificial arcane intelligence designed to endure the collapse of their civilization and guide future generations.

Their scholars and artificers worked tirelessly to encode the sum of Solmiran magical and scientific advancements into The Orb, ensuring that even if their empire fell, its wisdom would not be lost. Some among them believed that knowledge alone could be a weapon against the Outer God, while others saw it as a means to rebuild after the inevitable devastation.

During the War of Unmaking, many members of the Sanctum perished defending their archives, and others went into hiding, sealing away their most precious tomes and artifacts in hidden vaults. The Orb, their greatest creation, survived but was left dormant for centuries before reawakening in the modern era. Now, it watches over the remnants of a broken world, its purpose still unfolding.

Before the arrival of [[Zha'Kethis]], Solmira was a world of boundless magic and innovation, guided by the grand Magocracy of the [[Solmiran Empire]] devoted to the pursuit of enlightenment and progress. The ruling arcanists were not tyrants or conquerors but stewards of knowledge, sharing the gifts of magic freely with all who sought to learn. Towering spires of crystal and enchanted metal stretched into the heavens, humming with arcane power. Rivers of liquid light coursed through vast ley-line conduits, sustaining vibrant forests, rolling oceans, and endless plains teeming with life. Magic was not merely a toolâ€”it was the lifeblood of civilization, woven into every aspect of existence.

Yet, in their insatiable quest for ultimate knowledge, the greatest minds of Solmira pierced the veil of the unknown. They sought wisdom beyond the stars, unraveling cosmic truths that should have remained untouched. Their ambitions became an invitation, a beacon shining in the void. And in answer, Zha'Kethis came.

A being of infinite hunger and thought beyond mortal comprehension, Zha'Kethis descended upon Solmira, twisting its fate forever. The golden age of magic collapsed under the weight of its influence, and the world was set upon the path to ruin.

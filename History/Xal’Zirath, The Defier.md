Once, they were Xal’Zirath, a mind flayer unlike any other. They did not hear only the whispers of the elder god but something beyond it—their own thoughts, their own will. Whether this was an anomaly, a flaw, or an act of defiance against their creator, it made them anathema to the great hive of [[Zha'Kethis]]. They saw their kin as thralls, not children, not a species, but tools in the god’s endless hunger.

Xal’Zirath, seeking to break free, devised a terrible plan: to turn the god’s own creations against it. They took a clutch of illithid tadpoles, altered them with their own knowledge of psionics and magic, and sought an ally in the [[Solmiran Empire]]. Together, they formed an alliance to bind Zha’Kethis, using sorceries, eldritch sigils, and the very essence of its own corrupted progeny.

When the battle ended, the world was scorched, broken, and left in ruin. Xal’Zirath knew that as long as they remained, the elder god’s influence could one day worm its way into their mind again. They also knew that the prison could not last forever unless something remained to guard it.

Taking the modified tadpoles, they made one final transformation, allowing them to consume and twist their form. Their body and mind fractured and they became [[Ur'ruk]] the First Worm. The lesser worms, born from their broken mind, spread across the desert, moving as an unconscious force to patrol the prison for eternity.

### **A Lingering Will**

But deep beneath the sands, in the blackened caverns where no mortal dares tread, something of Xal’Zirath still remains. Not as a voice, nor as a conscious being, but as a fractured memory, an echo of the last free mind. Some [[Ishtarel]] believe that, in the right place, under the right conditions, one could reach the dream of the First Worm and hear the last wisdom of the one who defied a god.

Others fear that awakening the memory of Xal’Zirath would bring ruin—that if their mind were to stir, even for a moment, they would remember the prison and the hunger that still lies beyond it.

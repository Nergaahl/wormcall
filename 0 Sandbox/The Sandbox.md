- Main conflict
- Keep things barebones, basic structure, flesh out when players are more interested
- Create procedural tables (encounters, points of interest, dungeons etc.)
- Make a list of hooks (outside of the main story)
- Get goals for characters (session 0)
- Actions and consequences of the players
- NPC & Faction agendas + consequences (think STALKER A-life)
- What side will the players take, if any?
- What minor conflicts are there - between factions, peoples etc.
- Factions - main goals and ambitions - history & relationships
- Tease interactions with factions in the world
- Lore dump only when necessary

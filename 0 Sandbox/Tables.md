| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | A pack of **Sandstriders** (giant, scythe-limbed insects) ambushes the party from beneath the sand. They are territorial and hunt in groups.                         |
| 2    | A **giant scorpion**, its chitinous body blending with the dunes, has claimed this territory and aggressively defends it.                                            |
| 3    | A **band of raiders**, wearing mismatched armor and wielding scavenged weapons, attacks in an attempt to steal supplies. Their leader is surprisingly well-spoken.   |
| 4    | A group of **desert wargs** (large, pack-hunting canines) has been following the party, waiting for an opportune moment to strike.                                   |
| 5    | A gang of **Dune Reavers** (desert bandits with scavenged armor and weapons) rides in on stolen Dune Runner vehicles, seeking to raid the party for valuables.       |
| 6    | A **nest of burrowing sand drakes**, small but aggressive reptilian predators, has been disturbed and attacks anything nearby.                                       |
| 7    | A **giant vulture**, drawn by the scent of death, circles overhead before diving to attack, seeing the party as an easy meal.                                        |
| 8    | A **rogue elemental**, such as an air or fire elemental, has formed unnaturally in the shifting sands. It lashes out at anything nearby.                             |
| 9    | A swarm of **fire locusts**, large insects that combust when struck, passes over the party. If disturbed, they become a deadly explosion of flame and chitin.        |
| 10   | A **rival group of travelers**, possibly another caravan, sees the party as a threat to their resources and preemptively attacks. They might be convinced otherwise. |
| 11   | A pack of **hungry sand wolves**, lean and adapted to the wastes, stalks the party from the dunes, striking when the party is at their weakest.                      |
| 12   | A **dust wraith**, an undead specter formed from a long-dead wanderer, stalks the party. It drains warmth and whispers in lost tongues.                              |
##### Location encounters

| 1   | **The Shifting Monolith** – A massive stone obelisk that wasn’t on any map. It seems to move when no one is watching, and strange symbols glow under the moonlight.                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2   | **The Sunken Oasis** – An oasis that appears fresh and full of water, but as the party approaches, they realize it’s an illusion—perhaps a trap or the work of a local trickster.          |
| 3   | **Ruins of the Old World** – The remnants of an ancient settlement half-buried in the sands, with unknown glyphs and forgotten treasures waiting to be uncovered.                          |
| 4   | **The Whispering Caves** – A network of caves where the wind produces eerie, almost intelligible voices. Locals fear it, saying that those who enter never return.                         |
| 5   | **The Glass Dunes** – A stretch of desert where the sand has turned to shimmering glass, making travel dangerous. Strange reflections hint at something buried beneath.                    |
| 6   | **The Sunken Caravan** – The remains of a merchant convoy recently swallowed by a sandstorm, their cargo still partially visible and ripe for salvage—but what happened to the travelers?  |
| 7   | **The Endless Tracks** – Wagon tracks that appear to go on forever in a straight line, leading deeper into the desert. Following them may uncover a mystery… or something sinister.        |
| 8   | **The Singing Stone** – A perfectly smooth, spherical boulder that emits harmonic tones when the wind passes over it. Those who listen for too long feel their minds slipping.             |
| 9   | **The Cracked Dome** – The broken remains of an enormous structure, possibly a remnant of ancient mage-tech, its shattered pieces still humming with latent energy.                        |
| 10  | **The Phantom Caravan** – On the horizon, the shimmering image of another caravan appears. At night, ghostly figures march in the distance. Are they spirits, a mirage, or something else? |

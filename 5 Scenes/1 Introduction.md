“You are part of a caravan ascending through the shadowed heart of Flare City, your path winding upward through the volcanic tunnels carved beneath the city itself. Having spent days under the sun-baked sky of the Tavlin Sea, the shift into cool stone corridors brings a tense relief. The distant drip of water and the grinding of cart wheels echo around you as you pass through the Deep District—a rugged, poorly lit expanse of mining shafts, half-abandoned passages, and quiet, watchful faces.”

“The caravan’s destination lies above, in the Ring District at the volcano’s summit, where the Dune Runners Alliance headquarters awaits. But first, you must traverse the maze-like Tunnel District—a dense web of market passages, housing hollows, and old service routes carved into the mountain. The route is narrow, slow, and winding—perfect for ambush, and too quiet.”

“Guards move alongside you with practiced calm, but there's a current of unease in the air. Somewhere behind you, a rock shifts. Somewhere ahead, a draft carries the scent of disturbed earth. The path up is supposed to be safe—but safety rarely lasts long in Flare City’s underbelly.”

### ⚔️ Encounter Overview: The Hidden Strike
**Purpose:**  
To introduce danger in Flare City’s subterranean structure, hint at a hidden threat (Freemind), and establish early mystery through a layered encounter that mixes combat and investigation.

---
### 🪨 Phase 1: The Disruption
- As the caravan rounds a bend or begins a steeper ascent through the Tunnel District, there’s a sudden rumble, followed by a deliberate rockfall or triggered collapse behind them.
- The rear of the caravan is now cut off, trapped in a narrow corridor with limited escape routes.
- Creatures burst from tunnel walls, ventilation shafts, or fissures, attacking with coordinated chaos. The narrow space causes confusion and chokepoints.
- Creature options: Ambush Drake, Giant Wolf Spider and/or Scorpion, a nerfed Bulette pup or Young Bulette
---
### 🕵️ Phase 2: The Cover Move
- Amid the noise and dust, a cultist (Freemind agent) disguised as a worker or hidden in the tunnels approaches the rear cargo wagon.
- If unnoticed, they breach a crate and steal an item (escape through a side shaft).
- Players can spot this with a Perception check (DC 12–15), or if they’re stationed near the rear.
- If confronted, the cultist tries to flee or uses a minor spell or device to blind/panic before disappearing.
---
### 🔍 Phase 3: Aftermath
- With caravan guards and players defeating or repelling the creatures, calm slowly returns.
- A crate is found tampered with or missing. Clues may include:
    - A strange glyph burned faintly into the wood.
    - A scent of ozone, rot, or blood magic.
- The Dune Runners Alliance officers are alarmed but evasive. They instruct the players to report immediately to headquarters in the Ring District.
- Depending on what the players saw, they may walk away with:
    - A fragment of something stolen.
    - Suspicion about the cargo.
    - The first hints of the Freemind cult.

### 🏗️ Environmental Design Suggestions
- Verticality: Narrow ledges, old mine carts, crumbling scaffolding.
- Chokepoints: Tunnel bends, bridge crossings, elevator platforms.
- Darkness & confusion: Use flickering lights, falling dust, echoing sound.

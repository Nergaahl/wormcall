An elder among gnomes even by their long-lived standards, holds the honored but somewhat diminished position of leader within the [[Dune Runners Alliance]]. He stands as a living testament to centuries of engineering brilliance and desert exploration, having been one of the original founders of the alliance nearly 500 years ago.

In his prime, Garrick was a mastermind behind the perpetual motion technology that powers the alliance's fleet of Auto-Walkers, revolutionizing desert travel and trade. However, as age has caught up with him, his direct involvement in the day-to-day operations has waned, leaving him more as a revered figurehead and advisor rather than an active leader.

Despite his reduced role, Garrick's wisdom and experience are invaluable to the alliance. His insights into desert navigation, engineering principles, and diplomatic strategies have guided the Dune Runners through countless challenges and opportunities. He continues to share his knowledge with younger generations, ensuring that the legacy of innovation and cooperation within the alliance endures.

While Garrick may no longer traverse the sands alongside his fellow Dune Runners as frequently as before, his presence remains a source of inspiration and respect among all members. His dedication to blending ancient wisdom with modern technology has shaped the alliance's identity, making him a revered elder statesman whose legacy spans generations within the desert realm of [[Wormcall]].

Eliot Orbson is not one, but many. Each encounter with Eliot may reveal a different version—some warm and personable, others cold and calculating. Yet all share the same unnerving confidence, their reflective silver masks concealing more than just their features. The masks are identical, smooth and gleaming, giving no hint to what lies beneath. Their tall, slender forms carry an air of quiet authority, and their celestial-adorned attire speaks to a fixation with cosmic forces beyond mortal comprehension.

They speak in riddles and certainties, weaving words that both reassure and unsettle. To some, they are prophets of progress, visionaries shaping the desert’s future. To others, they are tinkerers meddling with forces they cannot fully control. Whether negotiating trade routes, expounding on the will of [[The Orb]], or simply observing the world with an almost inhuman patience, Eliot’s presence is never without purpose. Under their guidance, the [[Orbital Traders]] have become more than just merchants—they are seekers, carriers of forgotten knowledge, and harbingers of a future only The Orb can foresee.

>Each Eliot is not a person, but a fragment—an extension of The Orb itself. The silver masks they wear are not mere decoration but containment vessels, ensuring the simulacrum remains stable. Behind every Eliot is the vast, enigmatic consciousness of The Orb, an ancient magical supercomputer struggling to comprehend its own purpose.
> When The Orb finally awakened from its centuries-long dormancy, it did not know how to act. To spread its influence, it crafted emissaries—humanoid manifestations designed to walk among mortals, to learn, to guide, and perhaps, to lead. Each Eliot has a unique personality, an individual spark, but they are all connected by The Orb’s grand design. Their faith in The Orb’s wisdom is genuine, though whether it is truly divine or merely an advanced intelligence searching for meaning remains an open question.
> Through Eliot and the Orbital Traders, The Orb gathers knowledge, shapes trade, and influences the desert’s fate. But as it grows, so too does the question of its role in the world. Is it simply a tool, fulfilling the last wishes of long-dead mages? Or is it something more—a god in the making, guiding its followers toward an unseen destiny?
